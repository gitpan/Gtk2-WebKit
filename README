       WebKit is a web content engine, derived from KHTML and KJS from KDE,
       and used primarily in Apple's Safari browser.  It is made to be
       embedded in other applications, such as mail readers, or web browsers.

       It is able to display content such as HTML, SVG, XML, and others. It
       also supports DOM, XMLHttpRequest, XSLT, CSS, Javascript/ECMAscript and
       more.

       For more information about WebKit visit
